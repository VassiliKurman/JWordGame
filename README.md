# JWordGame

A Java desktop application that can randomly hide words in the text. The purpose of the application is to learn English for kids by forcing them to brainstorm the words.

* For example, the following text "Our woefully inadequate efforts in recycling make a strong case for tackling the problem at the source." after put in the application will filter and display the following output "Our xxxxx inadequate efforts in xxxxx make a strong xxxxx for tackling the problem at the source."

* In the application it is possible to adjust the percentage of the words that can be hidden, like 20% , 30% etc.

* Easy words like " the " and "or" etc.... will be not hidden . It is possible to choose to hide words that have more than 5 or other number of letters, depending on your needs.

* There is also possibility to choose to hide 2-3 consecutive words to make the kids to memorize the phrases. For example "Our woefully inadequate efforts in recycling make a strong case for tackling the problem at the source." after put in the application, it show the following text: "Our xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx in xxxxx make a xxxxx xxxxx for tackling the problem at the source."

* Sentences that have only one word will be not hidden, like example "Run". There is a filter for the sentences with minimum number of words in the sentence that can be hidden.
